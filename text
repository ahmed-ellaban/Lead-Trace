[ 2 ] Founded in 1975, the company became highly influential in the rise of personal computers through software like Windows , and the company has since expanded to Internet services, cloud computing , video gaming and other fields. Microsoft is the largest software maker , one of the most valuable public U.S. companies, [ a ] and one of the most valuable brands globally. Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800 . It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. During the 41 years from 1980 to 2021 Microsoft released 9 versions of MS-DOS with a median frequency of 2 years, and 13 versions of Windows with a median frequency of 3 years. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) and subsequent rise in its share price created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market. Steve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000.  He oversaw the then-largest of Microsoft's corporate acquisitions in Skype Technologies in 2011, [ 3 ] and an increased focus on hardware [ 4 ] [ 5 ] that led to its first in-house PC line, the Surface , in 2012, and the formation of Microsoft Mobile through Nokia . Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has changed focus towards cloud computing , [ 6 ] [ 7 ] as well as its large acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in 2016. [ 8 ] Under Nadella's direction, the company has also expanded its video gaming business to support the Xbox brand, establishing the Microsoft Gaming division in 2022, which is currently [ b ] the third-largest gaming company in the world by revenue, [ 9 ] following the 2023 acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion. [ 10 ] Microsoft has been market-dominant in the IBM PC–compatible operating system market and the office software suite market since the 1990s. Its best-known software products are the Windows line of operating systems and the Microsoft Office and Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, which most notably include the Word word processor and Excel spreadsheet editor. Its flagship hardware products are the Surface lineup of personal computers and Xbox video game consoles, the latter of which includes the Xbox network ; the company also provides a range of consumer Internet services such as Bing web search, the MSN web portal, the Outlook.com email service and the Microsoft Store . In the enterprise and development fields, Microsoft most notably provides the Azure cloud computing platform, Microsoft SQL Server database software, and Visual Studio . Microsoft is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet , [ c ] Amazon , Apple , and Meta . [ d ] In April 2019, Microsoft reached a trillion-dollar market cap , becoming the third public U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion . It has been criticized for its monopolistic practices, and the company's software has been criticized for problems with ease of use , robustness , and security . History Main article: History of Microsoft For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Microsoft . 1972–1985: Founding An Altair 8800 computer (left) with the popular Model 33 ASR Teletype as terminal, paper tape reader, and paper tape punch Paul Allen and Bill Gates on October 19, 1981, after signing a pivotal contract with IBM [ 11 ] : 228 Bill Gates and Paul Allen's Original Business Cards located in the Microsoft Visitor Center Childhood friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen sought to make a business using their skills in computer programming . [ 12 ] In 1972, they founded Traf-O-Data , which sold a rudimentary computer to track and analyze automobile traffic data. Gates enrolled at Harvard University while Allen pursued a degree in computer science at Washington State University , though he later dropped out to work at Honeywell . [ 13 ] The January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics featured Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems 's (MITS) Altair 8800 microcomputer, [ 14 ] which inspired Allen to suggest that they could program a BASIC interpreter for the device. Gates called MITS and claimed that he had a working interpreter, and MITS requested a demonstration. Allen worked on a simulator for the Altair while Gates developed the interpreter, and it worked flawlessly when they demonstrated it to MITS in March 1975 in Albuquerque, New Mexico . MITS agreed to distribute it, marketing it as Altair BASIC . [ 11 ] : 108, 112–114 Gates and Allen established Microsoft on April 4, 1975, with Gates as CEO, [ 15 ] and Allen suggested the name "Micro-Soft", short for micro-computer software. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] In August 1977, the company formed an agreement with ASCII Magazine in Japan, resulting in its first international office of ASCII Microsoft . [ 18 ] Microsoft moved its headquarters to Bellevue, Washington , in January 1979. [ 15 ] Microsoft entered the operating system (OS) business in 1980 with its own version of Unix called Xenix , [ 19 ] but it was MS-DOS that solidified the company's dominance. IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft in November 1980 to provide a version of the CP/M OS to be used in the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC). [ 20 ] For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products which it branded as MS-DOS, although IBM rebranded it to IBM PC DOS . Microsoft retained ownership of MS-DOS following the release of the IBM PC in August 1981. IBM had copyrighted the IBM PC BIOS , so other companies had to reverse engineer it for non-IBM hardware to run as IBM PC compatibles , but no such restriction applied to the operating systems. Microsoft eventually became the leading PC operating systems vendor. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] : 210 The company expanded into new markets with the release of the Microsoft Mouse in 1983, as well as with a publishing division named Microsoft Press . [ 11 ] : 232 Paul Allen resigned from Microsoft in 1983 after developing Hodgkin's lymphoma . [ 23 ] Allen claimed in Idea Man: A Memoir by the co-founder of Microsoft that Gates wanted to dilute his share in the company when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease because he did not think that he was working hard enough. [ 24 ] Allen later invested in low-tech sectors, sports teams, commercial real estate, neuroscience, private space flight, and more. [ 25 ] 1985–1994: Windows and Office Windows 1.0 was released on November 20, 1985, as the first version of the Windows line. Microsoft released Windows 1.0 on November 20, 1985, as a graphical extension for MS-DOS , [ 11 ] : 242–243, 246 despite having begun jointly developing OS/2 with IBM that August. [ 26 ] Microsoft moved its headquarters from Bellevue to Redmond, Washington , on February 26, 1986, and went public with an initial public offering (IPO) at the NASDAQ exchange on March 13, [ 27 ] with the resulting rise in stock making an estimated four billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees. [ 28 ] Microsoft released its version of OS/2 to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) on April 2, 1987. [ 11 ] In 1990, the Federal Trade Commission examined Microsoft for possible collusion due to the partnership with IBM, marking the beginning of more than a decade of legal clashes with the government. [ 29 ] : 243–244 Meanwhile, the company was at work on Microsoft Windows NT , which was heavily based on their copy of the OS/2 code. It shipped on July 21, 1993, with a new modular kernel and the 32-bit Win32 application programming interface (API), making it easier to port from 16-bit (MS-DOS-based) Windows. Microsoft informed IBM of Windows NT, and the OS/2 partnership deteriorated. [ 30 ] In 1990, Microsoft introduced the Microsoft Office suite which bundled separate applications such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel . [ 11 ] : 301 On May 22, Microsoft launched Windows 3.0 , featuring streamlined user interface graphics and improved protected mode capability for the Intel 386 processor, [ 31 ] and both Office and Windows became dominant in their respective areas. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] On July 27, 1994, the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division filed a competitive impact statement that said: "Beginning in 1988 and continuing until July 15, 1994, Microsoft induced many OEMs to execute anti-competitive 'per processor licenses. Under a per-processor license, an OEM pays Microsoft a royalty for each computer it sells containing a particular microprocessor, whether the OEM sells the computer with a Microsoft operating system or a non-Microsoft operating system. In effect, the royalty payment to Microsoft when no Microsoft product is being used acts as a penalty, or tax, on the OEM's use of a competing PC operating system. Since 1988, Microsoft's use of per processor licenses has increased." [ 34 ] 1995–2007: Foray into the Web, Windows 95, Windows XP, and Xbox In 1996, Microsoft released Windows CE , a version of the operating system meant for personal digital assistants and other tiny computers, shown here on the HP 300LX . Following Bill Gates's internal "Internet Tidal Wave memo" on May 26, 1995, Microsoft began to redefine its offerings and expand its product line into computer networking and the World Wide Web . [ 35 ] With a few exceptions of new companies, like Netscape , Microsoft was the only major and established company that acted fast enough to be a part of the World Wide Web practically from the start. Other companies like Borland , WordPerfect , Novell , IBM and Lotus , being much slower to adapt to the new situation, would give Microsoft market dominance. [ 36 ] The company released Windows 95 on August 24, 1995, featuring pre-emptive multitasking , a completely new user interface with a novel start button , and 32-bit compatibility; similar to NT, it provided the Win32 API. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] : 20 Windows 95 came bundled with the online service MSN , which was at first intended to be a competitor to the Internet, [ dubious – discuss ] and (for OEMs) Internet Explorer , a Web browser . Internet Explorer was not bundled with the retail Windows 95 boxes, because the boxes were printed before the team finished the Web browser, and instead were included in the Windows 95 Plus! pack. [ 39 ] Backed by a high-profile marketing campaign [ 40 ] and what The New York Times called "the splashiest, most frenzied, most expensive introduction of a computer product in the industry's history," [ 41 ] Windows 95 quickly became a success. [ 42 ] Branching out into new markets in 1996, Microsoft and General Electric 's NBC unit created a new 24/7 cable news channel, MSNBC . [ 43 ] Microsoft created Windows CE 1.0 , a new OS designed for devices with low memory and other constraints, such as personal digital assistants . [ 44 ] In October 1997, the Justice Department filed a motion in the Federal District Court , stating that Microsoft violated an agreement signed in 1994 and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows. [ 11 ] : 323–324 While primarily focused on software, Microsoft also produced a number of successful PC accessories, such as the IntelliMouse computer mice shown here Microsoft released the first installment in the Xbox series of consoles in 2001. The Xbox , graphically powerful compared to its rivals, featured a standard PC's 733 MHz Intel Pentium III processor. On January 13, 2000, Bill Gates handed over the CEO position to Steve Ballmer , an old college friend of Gates and employee of the company since 1980, while creating a new position for himself as Chief Software Architect . [ 11 ] : 111, 228 [ 15 ] Various companies including Microsoft formed the Trusted Computing Platform Alliance in October 1999 to (among other things) increase security and protect intellectual property through identifying changes in hardware and software. Critics decried the alliance as a way to enforce indiscriminate restrictions over how consumers use software, and over how computers behave, and as a form of digital rights management : for example, the scenario where a computer is not only secured for its owner but also secured against its owner as well. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] On April 3, 2000, a judgment was handed down in the case of United States v. Microsoft Corp. , [ 47 ] calling the company an "abusive monopoly." [ 48 ] Microsoft later settled with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2004. [ 27 ] On October 25, 2001, Microsoft released Windows XP , unifying the mainstream and NT lines of OS under the NT codebase. [ 49 ] The company released the Xbox later that year, entering the video game console market dominated by Sony and Nintendo . [ 50 ] In March 2004 the European Union brought antitrust legal action against the company , citing it abused its dominance with the Windows OS, resulting in a judgment of €497 million ($613 million) and requiring Microsoft to produce new versions of Windows XP without Windows Media Player : Windows XP Home Edition N and Windows XP Professional N. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] In November 2005, the company's second video game console, the Xbox 360 , was released. There were two versions, a basic version for $299.99 and a deluxe version for $399.99. [ 53 ] Increasingly present in the hardware business following Xbox, Microsoft 2006 released the Zune series of digital media players, a successor of its previous software platform Portable Media Center . These expanded on previous hardware commitments from Microsoft following its original Microsoft Mouse in 1983; as of 2007 the company sold the best-selling wired keyboard ( Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 ), mouse ( IntelliMouse ), and desktop webcam ( LifeCam ) in the United States. That year the company also launched the Surface "digital table", later renamed PixelSense . [ 54 ] 2007–2011: Microsoft Azure, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Microsoft Stores CEO Steve Ballmer at the MIX event in 2008. In an interview about his management style in 2005, he mentioned that his first priority was to get the people he delegates to in order. Ballmer also emphasized the need to continue pursuing new technologies even if initial attempts fail, citing the original attempts with Windows as an example. [ 55 ] Headquarters of the European Commission , which has imposed several fines on Microsoft Released in January 2007, the next version of Windows, Vista , focused on features, security and a redesigned user interface dubbed Aero . [ 56 ] [ 57 ] Microsoft Office 2007 , released at the same time, featured a " Ribbon " user interface which was a significant departure from its predecessors. Relatively strong sales of both products helped to produce a record profit in 2007. [ 58 ] The European Union imposed another fine of €899 million ($1.4 billion) for Microsoft's lack of compliance with the March 2004 judgment on February 27, 2008, saying that the company charged rivals unreasonable prices for key information about its workgroup and backoffice servers. [ 59 ] Microsoft stated that it was in compliance and that "these fines are about the past issues that have been resolved". [ 60 ] 2007 also saw the creation of a multi-core unit at Microsoft, following the steps of server companies such as Sun and IBM. [ 61 ] Gates retired from his role as Chief Software Architect on June 27, 2008, a decision announced in June 2006, while retaining other positions related to the company in addition to being an advisor for the company on key projects. [ 62 ] [ 63 ] Azure Services Platform , the company's entry into the cloud computing market for Windows, launched on October 27, 2008. [ 64 ] On February 12, 2009, Microsoft announced its intent to open a chain of Microsoft-branded retail stores, and on October 22, 2009, the first retail Microsoft Store opened in Scottsdale, Arizona ; the same day Windows 7 was officially released to the public. Windows 7's focus was on refining Vista with ease-of-use features and performance enhancements, rather than an extensive reworking of Windows. [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 67 ] As the smartphone industry boomed in the late 2000s, Microsoft had struggled to keep up with its rivals in providing a modern smartphone operating system, falling behind Apple and Google -sponsored Android in the United States. [ 68 ] As a result, in 2010 Microsoft revamped their aging flagship mobile operating system, Windows Mobile , replacing it with the new Windows Phone OS that was released in October that year. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] It used a new user interface design language, codenamed "Metro", which prominently used simple shapes, typography, and iconography, utilizing the concept of minimalism. Microsoft implemented a new strategy for the software industry, providing a consistent user experience across all smartphones using the Windows Phone OS. It launched an alliance with Nokia in 2011 and Microsoft worked closely with the company to co-develop Windows Phone, [ 71 ] but remained partners with long-time Windows Mobile OEM HTC . [ 72 ] Microsoft is a founding member of the Open Networking Foundation started on March 23, 2011. Fellow founders were Google , HPE Networking , Yahoo! , Verizon Communications , Deutsche Telekom and 17 other companies. This nonprofit organization is focused on providing support for a cloud computing initiative called Software-Defined Networking. [ 73 ] The initiative is meant to speed innovation through simple software changes in telecommunications networks, wireless networks, data centers, and other networking areas. [ 74 ] 2011–2014: Windows 8/8.1, Xbox One, Outlook.com, and Surface devices Surface Pro 3 , part of the Surface series of 2-in-1 laptops by Microsoft Following the release of Windows Phone , Microsoft undertook a gradual rebranding of its product range throughout 2011 and 2012, with the corporation's logos, products, services, and websites adopting the principles and concepts of the Metro design language . [ 75 ] Microsoft unveiled Windows 8 , an operating system designed to power both personal computers and tablet computers , in Taipei in June 2011. [ 76 ] A developer preview was released on September 13, which was subsequently replaced by a consumer preview on February 29, 2012, and released to the public in May. [ 77 ] The Surface was unveiled on June 18, becoming the first computer in the company's history to have its hardware made by Microsoft. [ 78 ] [ 79 ] On June 25, Microsoft paid US$1.2 billion to buy the social network Yammer . [ 80 ] On July 31, they launched the Outlook.com webmail service to compete with Gmail . [ 81 ] On September 4, 2012, Microsoft released Windows Server 2012 . [ 82 ] In July 2012, Microsoft sold its 50% stake in MSNBC, which it had run as a joint venture with NBC since 1996. [ 83 ] On October 1, Microsoft announced its intention to launch a news operation, part of a new-look MSN , with Windows 8 later in the month. [ 84 ] On October 26, 2012, Microsoft launched Windows 8 and the Microsoft Surface . [ 79 ] [ 85 ] Three days later, Windows Phone 8 was launched. [ 86 ] To cope with the potential for an increase in demand for products and services, Microsoft opened a number of "holiday stores" across the U.S. to complement the increasing number of "bricks-and-mortar" Microsoft Stores that opened in 2012. [ 87 ] On March 29, 2013, Microsoft launched a Patent Tracker. [ 88 ] In August 2012, the New York City Police Department announced a partnership with Microsoft for the development of the Domain Awareness System which is used for Police surveillance in New York City . [ 89 ] The Xbox One console, released in 2013 The Kinect , a motion-sensing input device made by Microsoft and designed as a video game controller , first introduced in November 2010, was upgraded for the 2013 release of the Xbox One video game console. Kinect's capabilities were revealed in May 2013: an ultra-wide 1080p camera, function in the dark due to an infrared sensor, higher-end processing power and new software, the ability to distinguish between fine movements (such as a thumb movement), and determining a user's heart rate by looking at their face. [ 90 ] Microsoft filed a patent application in 2011 that suggests that the corporation may use the Kinect camera system to monitor the behavior of television viewers as part of a plan to make the viewing experience more interactive. [ 91 ] On July 19, 2013, Microsoft stocks suffered their biggest one-day percentage sell-off since the year 2000, after its fourth-quarter report raised concerns among investors on the poor showings of both Windows 8 and the Surface tablet. Microsoft suffered a loss of more than US$32 billion. [ 92 ] In line with the maturing PC business, in July 2013, Microsoft announced that it would reorganize the business into four new business divisions, namely Operating systems, Apps, Cloud, and Devices. All previous divisions will be dissolved into new divisions without any workforce cuts. [ 93 ] On September 3, 2013, Microsoft agreed to buy Nokia 's mobile unit for $7 billion, [ 94 ] following Amy Hood taking the role of CFO. [ 95 ] 2014–2020: Windows 10, Microsoft Edge, and HoloLens Satya Nadella succeeded Steve Ballmer as the CEO of Microsoft in February 2014. On February 4, 2014, Steve Ballmer stepped down as CEO of Microsoft and was succeeded by Satya Nadella , who previously led Microsoft's Cloud and Enterprise division. [ 96 ] On the same day, John W. Thompson took on the role of chairman, in place of Bill Gates, who continued to participate as a technology advisor. [ 97 ] Thompson became the second chairman in Microsoft's history. [ 98 ] On April 25, 2014, Microsoft acquired Nokia Devices and Services for $7.2 billion. [ 99 ] This new subsidiary was renamed Microsoft Mobile Oy. [ 100 ] On September 15, 2014, Microsoft acquired the video game development company Mojang , best known for Minecraft , for $2.5 billion. [ 101 ] On June 8, 2017, Microsoft acquired Hexadite , an Israeli security firm, for $100 million. [ 102 ] [ 103 ] On January 21, 2015, Microsoft announced the release of their first Interactive whiteboard , Microsoft Surface Hub .

[ 172 ] [ 173 ] However, the plan was short-lived, as Altman was subsequently reinstated as OpenAI's CEO and Brockman rejoined the company amid pressure from OpenAI's employees and investors on its board. [ 174 ] In March 2024, Inflection AI 's cofounders Mustafa Suleyman and Karen Simonyan announced their departure from the company in order to start Microsoft AI, with Microsoft acqui-hiring nearly the entirety of its 70-person workforce.

[ 186 ] [ 187 ] On July 19, 2024, a global IT outage impacted Microsoft services, affecting businesses, airlines, and financial institutions worldwide. The outage was traced back to a flawed update of CrowdStrike 's cybersecurity software, which resulted in Microsoft systems crashing and causing disruptions across various sectors. Despite CrowdStrike's CEO George Kurtz clarifying that the issue was not a cyberattack, the incident had widespread consequences, leading to delays in air travel, financial transactions, and medical services globally. Microsoft stated that the underlying cause had been fixed but acknowledged ongoing residual impacts on some Microsoft 365 apps and services. [ 188 ] [ 189 ] In September 2024, BlackRock and Microsoft announced a $30 billion fund, the Global AI Infrastructure Investment Partnership, to invest in AI infrastructure such as data centers and energy projects. The fund has the potential to reach $100 billion with debt financing, and partners include Abu Dhabi -backed MGX and Nvidia , which will provide AI expertise. Investments will primarily focus on the U.S., with some in partner countries. [ 190 ] Microsoft also announced relaunch of its controversial tool, Recall, in November 2024 after addressing privacy concerns. Initially criticized for taking regular screenshots without user consent, Recall was changed to an opt-in feature instead of being default on. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office monitored the situation and noted the adjustments, which included enhanced security measures like encryption and biometric access. While experts regarded these changes as improvements, they advised caution, with some recommending further testing before users opted in.

[ 203 ] [ 204 ] Though the company had subsequent increases in dividend payouts, the price of Microsoft's stock remained steady for years. [ 204 ] [ 205 ] Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service have both given a AAA rating to Microsoft, whose assets were valued at $41 billion as compared to only $8.5 billion in unsecured debt. Consequently, in February 2011 Microsoft released a corporate bond amounting to $2.25 billion with relatively low borrowing rates compared to government bonds . [ 206 ] For the first time in 20 years Apple Inc. surpassed Microsoft in Q1 2011 quarterly profits and revenues due to a slowdown in PC sales and continuing huge losses in Microsoft's Online Services Division (which contains its search engine Bing ). Microsoft profits were $5.2 billion, while Apple Inc. profits were $6 billion, on revenues of $14.5 billion and $24.7 billion respectively.

The two-year contract may result in follow-on orders of more than 100,000 headsets, according to documentation describing the bidding process. One of the contract's tag lines for the augmented reality technology seems to be its ability to enable "25 bloodless battles before the 1st battle", suggesting that actual combat training is going to be an essential aspect of the augmented reality headset capabilities. [ 219 ] Subsidiaries Microsoft is an international business. As such, it needs subsidiaries present in whatever national markets it chooses to harvest. An example is Microsoft Canada, which it established in 1985. [ 220 ] Other countries have similar installations, to funnel profits back up to Redmond and to distribute the dividends to the holders of MSFT stock. Ownership The 10 largest shareholder of Microsoft in early 2024 were: [ 209 ] [ 221 ] Shareholder name Percentage The Vanguard Group 8.9% BlackRock 5.6% State Street Corporation 4.0% Steve Ballmer 4.0% Fidelity Investments 2.9% Geode Capital Management 2.1% T. Rowe Price International 1.9% Eaton Vance 1.7% JP Morgan Investment Management 1.6% Bill Gates 1.4% BlackRock Life 1.4% Others 68.5% Marketing Windows 8 Launch Event in Akihabara , Tokyo on October 25, 2012 In 2004, Microsoft commissioned research firms to do independent studies comparing the total cost of ownership (TCO) of Windows Server 2003 to Linux ; the firms concluded that companies found Windows easier to administrate than Linux, thus those using Windows would administrate faster resulting in lower costs for their company (i.e. lower TCO). [ 222 ] This spurred a wave of related studies; a study by the Yankee Group concluded that upgrading from one version of Windows Server to another costs a fraction of the switching costs from Windows Server to Linux, although companies surveyed noted the increased security and reliability of Linux servers and concern about being locked into using Microsoft products. [ 223 ] Another study, released by the Open Source Development Labs , claimed that the Microsoft studies were "simply outdated and one-sided" and their survey concluded that the TCO of Linux was lower due to Linux administrators managing more servers on average and other reasons. [ 224 ] As part of the "Get the Facts" campaign, Microsoft highlighted the .NET Framework trading platform that it had developed in partnership with Accenture for the London Stock Exchange , claiming that it provided " five nines " reliability. After suffering extended downtime and unreliability [ 225 ] [ 226 ] the London Stock Exchange announced in 2009 that it was planning to drop its Microsoft solution and switch to a Linux-based one in 2010. [ 227 ] [ 228 ] In 2012, Microsoft hired a political pollster named Mark Penn, whom The New York Times called "famous for bulldozing" his political opponents [ 229 ] as Executive Vice-president, Advertising and Strategy. Penn created a series of negative advertisements targeting one of Microsoft's chief competitors, Google . The advertisements, called " Scroogled ", attempt to make the case that Google is "screwing" consumers with search results rigged to favor Google's paid advertisers, that Gmail violates the privacy of its users to place ad results related to the content of their emails and shopping results, which favor Google products. Tech publications like TechCrunch have been highly critical of the advertising campaign, [ 230 ] while Google employees have embraced it. [ 231 ] Layoffs In July 2014, Microsoft announced plans to lay off 18,000 employees. Microsoft employed 127,104 people as of June 5, 2014, making this about a 14 percent reduction of its workforce as the biggest Microsoft layoff ever. This included 12,500 professional and factory personnel. Previously, Microsoft had eliminated 5,800 jobs in 2009 in line with the Great Recession of 2008–2017. [ 232 ] [ 233 ] In September 2014, Microsoft laid off 2,100 people, including 747 people in the Seattle–Redmond area, where the company is headquartered. The firings came as a second wave of the layoffs that were previously announced. This brought the total number to over 15,000 out of the 18,000 expected cuts. [ 234 ] In October 2014, Microsoft revealed that it was almost done with eliminating 18,000 employees, which was its largest-ever layoff sweep. [ 235 ] In July 2015, Microsoft announced another 7,800 job cuts in the next several months. [ 236 ] In May 2016, Microsoft announced another 1,850 job cuts mostly in its Nokia mobile phone division. As a result, the company will record an impairment and restructuring charge of approximately $950 million, of which approximately $200 million will relate to severance payments. [ 237 ] Microsoft laid off 1,900 employees in its gaming division in January 2024. The layoffs primarily affected Activision Blizzard employees, but some Xbox and ZeniMax employees were also affected. [ 238 ] Blizzard president Mike Ybarra and Blizzard's chief design officer Allen Adham also resigned. [ 239 ] Unions Microsoft recognizes seven trade unions [ f ] representing 1,750 workers in the United States at its video game subsidiaries Activision Blizzard and ZeniMax Media . [ 240 ] U.S. workers have been vocal in opposing military and law-enforcement contracts with Microsoft. [ 241 ] Bethesda Game Studios is unionized in Canada . [ 242 ] Microsoft South Korea recognizes its union since 2017. [ 243 ] [ 244 ] German employees have elected works councils since 1998. [ 245 ] United States government Microsoft provides information about reported bugs in their software to intelligence agencies of the United States government, prior to the public release of the fix. A Microsoft spokesperson has stated that the corporation runs several programs that facilitate the sharing of such information with the U.S. government. [ 246 ] Following media reports about PRISM , NSA's massive electronic surveillance program , in May 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Microsoft. [ 247 ] According to leaks of said program, Microsoft joined the PRISM program in 2007. [ 248 ] However, in June 2013, an official statement from Microsoft flatly denied their participation in the program: "We provide customer data only when we receive a legally binding order or subpoena to do so, and never on a voluntary basis. In addition, we only ever comply with orders for requests about specific accounts or identifiers. If the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data, we don't participate in it." [ 249 ] During the first six months of 2013, Microsoft received requests that affected between 15,000 and 15,999 accounts. [ 250 ] In December 2013, the company made a statement to further emphasize the fact that they take their customers' privacy and data protection very seriously, even saying that "government snooping potentially now constitutes an ' advanced persistent threat ,' alongside sophisticated malware and cyber attacks". [ 251 ] The statement also marked the beginning of three-part program to enhance Microsoft's encryption and transparency efforts. On July 1, 2014, as part of this program, they opened the first (of many) Microsoft Transparency Center, which provides "participating governments with the ability to review source code for our key products, assure themselves of their software integrity, and confirm there are no " back doors ." [ 252 ] Microsoft has also argued that the United States Congress should enact strong privacy regulations to protect consumer data. [ 253 ] In April 2016, the company sued the U.S. government , argued that secrecy orders were preventing the company from disclosing warrants to customers in violation of the company's and customers' rights. Microsoft argued that it was unconstitutional for the government to indefinitely ban Microsoft from informing its users that the government was requesting their emails and other documents and that the Fourth Amendment made it so people or businesses had the right to know if the government searches or seizes their property. On October 23, 2017, Microsoft said it would drop the lawsuit as a result of a policy change by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ). The DoJ had "changed data request rules on alerting the Internet users about agencies accessing their information." In 2022 Microsoft shared a $9 billion contract from the United States Department of Defense for cloud computing with Amazon, Google, and Oracle. [ 254 ] Security challenges On a Friday afternoon in January 2024, Microsoft disclosed that a Russian state-sponsored group hacked into its corporate systems. The group, accessed "a very small percentage" of Microsoft corporate email accounts, which also included members of its senior leadership team and employees in its cybersecurity and legal teams. [ 255 ] Microsoft noted in a blog post that the attack might have been prevented if the accounts in question had enabled multi-factor authentication , a defensive measure which is widely recommended in the industry, including by Microsoft itself. [ 256 ] Corporate identity Corporate culture Technical references for developers and articles for various Microsoft magazines such as Microsoft Systems Journal ( MSJ ) are available through the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN). MSDN also offers subscriptions for companies and individuals, and the more expensive subscriptions usually offer access to pre-release beta versions of Microsoft software. [ 257 ] [ 258 ] In April 2004, Microsoft launched a community site for developers and users, titled Channel 9 , that provides a wiki and an Internet forum . [ 259 ] Another community site that provides daily videocasts and other services, On10.net, launched on March 3, 2006. [ 260 ] Free technical support is traditionally provided through online Usenet newsgroups, and CompuServe in the past, monitored by Microsoft employees; there can be several newsgroups for a single product. Helpful people can be elected by peers or Microsoft employees for Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) status, which entitles them to a sort of special social status and possibilities for awards and other benefits. [ 261 ] Noted for its internal lexicon , the expression " eating your own dog food " is used to describe the policy of using pre-release and beta versions of products inside Microsoft to test them in "real-world" situations. [ 262 ] This is usually shortened to just "dog food" and is used as a noun, verb, and adjective. Another bit of jargon , FYIFV or FYIV (" Fuck You, I'm [Fully] Vested"), is used by an employee to indicate they are financially independent and can avoid work anytime they wish. [ 263 ] Microsoft is an outspoken opponent of the cap on H-1B visas , which allows companies in the U.S. to employ certain foreign workers. Bill Gates claims the cap on H1B visas makes it difficult to hire employees for the company, stating "I'd certainly get rid of the H1B cap" in 2005. [ 264 ] Critics of H1B visas argue that relaxing the limits would result in increased unemployment for U.S. citizens due to H1B workers working for lower salaries. [ 265 ] The Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, a report of how progressive the organization deems company policies towards LGBT employees, rated Microsoft as 87% from 2002 to 2004 and as 100% from 2005 to 2010 after they allowed gender expression. [ 266 ] In August 2018, Microsoft implemented a policy for all companies providing subcontractors to require 12 weeks of paid parental leave to each employee. This expands on the former requirement from 2015 requiring 15 days of paid vacation and sick leave each year. [ 267 ] In 2015, Microsoft established its own parental leave policy to allow 12 weeks off for parental leave with an additional 8 weeks for the parent who gave birth. [ 268 ] Environment In 2011, Greenpeace released a report rating the top ten big brands in cloud computing on their sources of electricity for their data centers . At the time, data centers consumed up to 2% of all global electricity, and this amount was projected to increase. Phil Radford of Greenpeace said, "We are concerned that this new explosion in electricity use could lock us into old, polluting energy sources instead of the clean energy available today", [ 269 ] and called on "Amazon, Microsoft and other leaders of the information-technology industry must embrace clean energy to power their cloud-based data centers". [ 270 ] In 2013, Microsoft agreed to buy power generated by a Texas wind project to power one of its data centers. [ 271 ] Microsoft is ranked on the 17th place in Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics (16th Edition) that ranks 18 electronics manufacturers according to their policies on toxic chemicals, recycling, and climate change. [ 272 ] Microsoft's timeline for phasing out brominated flame retardant (BFRs) and phthalates in all products was 2012 but its commitment to phasing out PVC is not clear. As of January 2011, [update] it has no products that are completely free from PVC and BFRs. [ 273 ] [ needs update ] Microsoft's main U.S. campus received a silver certification from the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program in 2008, and it installed over 2,000 solar panels on top of its buildings at its Silicon Valley campus, generating approximately 15 percent of the total energy needed by the facilities in April 2005. [ 274 ] Microsoft makes use of alternative forms of transit. It created one of the world's largest private bus systems, the "Connector", to transport people from outside the company; for on-campus transportation, the "Shuttle Connect" uses a large fleet of hybrid cars to save fuel. The "Connector" does not compete with the public bus system and works with it to provide a cohesive transportation network not just for its employees but also for the public. [ 275 ] Microsoft also subsidizes regional public transport , provided by Sound Transit and King County Metro , as an incentive. [ 274 ] [ 276 ] In February 2010, however, Microsoft took a stance against adding additional public transport and high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to the State Route 520 and its floating bridge connecting Redmond to Seattle; the company did not want to delay the construction any further. [ 277 ] Microsoft was ranked number 1 in the list of the World's Best Multinational Workplaces by the Great Place to Work Institute in 2011. [ 278 ] In January 2020, the company announced a strategy to take the company carbon negative by 2030 and to remove all carbon that it has emitted since its foundation in 1975. [ 279 ] [ 280 ] [ 281 ] On October 9, 2020, Microsoft permanently allowed remote work . [ 282 ] In January 2021, the company announced on Twitter to join the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact , which engages the cloud infrastructure and data centers industries to reach carbon neutrality in Europe by 2030, and also disclosed an investment in Climeworks , a direct air capture company partnered with Carbfix for carbon sequestration . [ list 1 ] In the same year, it was awarded the EPA's Green Power Leadership Award, citing the company's all-renewable energy use since 2014. [ 288 ] In September 2023, Microsoft announced that it purchased $200 million in carbon credits to offset 315,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide over 10 years from Heirloom Carbon, a carbon removal company that mixes calcium oxide from heated crushed limestone with water to form carbon hydroxide to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to mineralize back into limestone while the released carbon dioxide is stored underground or injected into concrete . [ 289 ] [ 290 ] Despite spending spent more than $760 million through its Climate Innovation Fund by June 2024 on sustainability projects—including purchases of more than 5 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide removal with carbon offsets and more than 34 megawatts of renewable energy—Microsoft's Scope 3 emissions had increased by 31% from the company's 2020 baseline, which caused the company's total emissions to rise by 29% in 2023. [ 291 ] In 2023 Microsoft consumed 24 TWh of electricity, more than countries such as Iceland, Ghana, the Dominican Republic, or Tunisia. [ 292 ] Headquarters Building 92, home to the Microsoft Visitor Center The corporate headquarters, informally known as the Microsoft Redmond campus , is located at One Microsoft Way in Redmond, Washington. Microsoft initially moved onto the grounds of the campus on February 26, 1986, weeks before the company went public on March 13. The headquarters has since experienced multiple expansions since its establishment. It is estimated to encompass over 8 million ft 2 (750,000 m 2 ) of office space and 30,000–40,000 employees. [ 293 ] Additional offices are located in Bellevue and Issaquah, Washington (90,000 employees worldwide). The company is planning to upgrade its Mountain View, California, campus on a grand scale. The company has occupied this campus since 1981. In 2016, the company bought the 32-acre (13 ha) campus, with plans to renovate and expand it by 25%. [ 294 ] Microsoft operates an East Coast headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina . [ 295 ] In April 2024, it was announced that Microsoft would be opening a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence 'hub' around Paddington in London, England. It was announced that the division would be led by Jordan Hoffman, who previously worked for Deepmind and Inflection . [ 296 ] Flagship stores Microsoft's Toronto flagship store On October 26, 2015, the company opened its retail location on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The location features a five-story glass storefront and is 22,270 square feet. [ 297 ] As per company executives, Microsoft had been on the lookout for a flagship location since 2009. [ 298 ] The company's retail locations are part of a greater strategy to help build a connection with its consumers. The opening of the store coincided with the launch of the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4. [ 299 ] On November 12, 2015, Microsoft opened a second flagship store, located in Sydney's Pitt Street Mall. [ 300 ] Logo Microsoft adopted the so-called " Pac-Man Logo", designed by Scott Baker, on February 26, 1987, with the concept being similar to InFocus Corporation logo that was adapted a year earlier in 1986. Baker stated "The new logo, in Helvetica italic typeface, has a slash between the o and s to emphasize the "soft" part of the name and convey motion and speed". [ 301 ] Dave Norris ran an internal joke campaign to save the old logo, which was green, in all uppercase, and featured a fanciful letter O , nicknamed the blibbet , but it was discarded. [ 302 ] Microsoft's logo with the tagline "Your potential. Our passion."—below the main corporate name—is based on a slogan Microsoft used in 2008. In 2002, the company started using the logo in the United States and eventually started a television campaign with the slogan, changed from the previous tagline of " Where do you want to go today? " [ 303 ] [ 304 ] [ 305 ] During the private MGX (Microsoft Global Exchange) conference in 2010, Microsoft unveiled the company's next tagline, "Be What's Next." [ 306 ] They also had a slogan/tagline "Making it all make sense." [ 307 ] The Microsoft Pac-Man logo was used for 25 years, 5 months, and 28 days until August 23, 2012, being the longest enduring logo to be used by the company. On August 23, 2012, Microsoft unveiled a new corporate logo at the opening of its 23rd Microsoft store in Boston, indicating the company's shift of focus from the classic style to the tile-centric modern interface, which it uses/will use on the Windows Phone platform, Xbox 360, Windows 8 and the upcoming Office Suites. [ 308 ] The new logo also includes four squares with the colors of the then-current Windows logo which have been used to represent Microsoft's four major products: Windows (blue), Office (orange), Xbox (green) and Bing (yellow). [ 309 ] The logo also resembles the opening of one of the commercials for Windows 95 . [ 310 ] [ 311 ] Microsoft logo history ca. 1975 – 1980: First Microsoft logo. 1980–June 25, 1982: Second Microsoft logo. June 25, 1982 – February 26, 1987: Third Microsoft logo. February 26, 1987 – August 23, 2012: Microsoft " Pac-Man " logo, designed by Scott Baker. [ 303 ] [ 304 ] August 23, 2012–present: Fifth and current Microsoft logo. [ 312 ] Sponsorship Toyota Yaris WRC with sprayed on Microsoft logos The company was the official jersey sponsor of Finland's national basketball team at EuroBasket 2015 . [ 313 ] The company was a major sponsor of the Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT ( 2017 – 2020 ). The company was a sponsor of the Renault F1 Team ( 2016 – 2020 ). Philanthropy In 2015, Microsoft Philanthropies, an internal charitable organization, was established. Its mission is to bring the benefits of technology to parts of the world and segments of the population that have been denied the benefits of the digital revolution. Key areas of focus: donating cloud computing resources to university researchers and nonprofit groups; supporting the expansion of broadband access worldwide; funding international computer science education through YouthSpark; supporting tech education in the U.S. from kindergarten to high school; and donating to global child and refugee relief organizations. [ 314 ] [ 315 ] During the COVID-19 pandemic , Microsoft's president, Brad Smith , announced that an initial batch of supplies, including 15,000 protection goggles, infrared thermometers , medical caps, and protective suits, was donated to Seattle, with further aid to come soon. [ 316 ] During Russian invasion of Ukraine Microsoft started monitoring cyberattacks originating from the Government of Russia and Russia-backed hackers. In June 2022, Microsoft published the report on Russian cyber attacks and concluded that state-backed Russian hackers "have engaged in "strategic espionage" against governments, think tanks , businesses and aid groups " in 42 countries supporting Kyiv . [ 317 ] [ 318 ] Controversies Main articles: Microsoft litigation and Criticism of Microsoft Criticism of Microsoft has followed various aspects of its products and business practices. Frequently criticized are the ease of use , robustness , and security of the company's software. They have also been criticized for the use of permatemp employees (employees employed for years as "temporary", and therefore without medical benefits), the use of forced retention tactics, which means that employees would be sued if they tried to leave. [ 319 ] Historically, Microsoft has also been accused of overworking employees, in many cases, leading to burnout within just a few years of joining the company. The company is often referred to as a "Velvet Sweatshop", a term which originated in a 1989 Seattle Times article, [ 320 ] and later became used to describe the company by some of Microsoft's own employees. [ 321 ] This characterization is derived from the perception that Microsoft provides nearly everything for its employees in a convenient place, but in turn overworks them to a point where it would be bad for their (possibly long-term) health. As reported by several news outlets, [ 322 ] [ 323 ] an Irish subsidiary of Microsoft based in the Republic of Ireland declared £220 bn in profits but paid no corporation tax for the year 2020. This is due to the company being tax resident in Bermuda as mentioned in the accounts for 'Microsoft Round Island One, a subsidiary that collects license fees from the use of Microsoft software worldwide. Dame Margaret Hodge , a Labour MP in the UK said, "It is unsurprising – yet still shocking – that massively wealthy global corporations openly, unashamedly and blatantly refuse to pay tax on the profits they make in the countries where they undertake business". [ 323 ] In 2020, ProPublica reported that the company had diverted more than $39 billion in U.S. profits to Puerto Rico using a mechanism structured to make it seem as if the company was unprofitable on paper. As a result, the company paid a tax rate on those profits of "nearly 0%". When the Internal Revenue Service audited these transactions, ProPublica reported that Microsoft aggressively fought back, including successfully lobbying Congress to change the law to make it harder for the agency to conduct audits of large corporations. [ 324 ] [ 325 ] In 2023, Microsoft reported in a securities filing that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service was alleging that the company owed the U.S. $28.9 billion in past taxes, plus penalties related to mis-allocation of corporate profits over a decade. [ 326 ] "Embrace, extend, and extinguish" (EEE), [ 327 ] also known as "embrace, extend, and exterminate," [ 328 ] is a phrase that the U.S. Department of Justice found [ 329 ] that was used internally by Microsoft [ 330 ] to describe its strategy for entering product categories involving widely used standards, extending those standards with proprietary capabilities, and then using those differences to strongly disadvantage competitors. Microsoft is frequently accused of using anticompetitive tactics and abusing its monopolistic power. People who use their products and services often end up becoming dependent on them, a process is known as vendor lock-in . Microsoft was the first company to participate in the PRISM surveillance program , according to leaked NSA documents obtained by The Guardian [ 331 ] and The Washington Post [ 332 ] in June 2013, and acknowledged by government officials following the leak. [ 333 ] The program authorizes the government to secretly access data of non-US citizens hosted by American companies without a warrant. Microsoft has denied participation in such a program. [ 334 ] Jesse Jackson believes Microsoft should hire more minorities and women. In 2015, he praised Microsoft for appointing two women to its board of directors. [ 335 ] In 2020, Salesforce , the manufacturer of the Slack platform, complained to European regulators about Microsoft due to the integration of the Teams service into Office 365. Negotiations with the European Commission continued until the summer of 2023, but, as it became known to the media, they reached an impasse. Microsoft is now facing an antitrust investigation. [ 336 ] In June 2024, Microsoft Corp. faced a potential EU fine after regulators accused it of abusing market power by bundling its Teams video-conferencing app with its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software. The European Commission issued a statement of objections, alleging Microsoft's practice since 2019 gave Teams an unfair market advantage and limited interoperability with competing software. Despite Microsoft's efforts to avoid deeper scrutiny, including unbundling Teams, regulators remained unconvinced. This action followed a 2019 complaint from Slack, which was later acquired by Salesforce. Microsoft's Teams usage soared during the pandemic, growing from 2 million daily users in 2017 to 300 million in 2023. The company has a history of antitrust battles in the U.S. and Europe, with over €2 billion in EU fines previously imposed for similar abuses. [ 337 ] In October 2024, Microsoft fired two employees who organized an unauthorized vigil at its Redmond headquarters to honor Palestinians killed in Gaza during the conflict with Hamas. The employees, part of the group "No Azure for Apartheid," sought to address the company's involvement in the Israeli government's use of its technology. [ 338 ] In November 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched an investigation into Microsoft, focusing on potential antitrust violations related to its cloud computing, AI, and cybersecurity businesses. The probe scrutinized Microsoft's bundling of cloud services with products like Office and security tools, as well as its growing AI presence through its partnership with OpenAI. This inquiry is part of broader efforts by the U.S. government to curb the power of major tech companies, especially under FTC chair Lina Khan. Concerns were raised about Microsoft's licensing practices potentially locking customers into its services and its AI investments possibly sidestepping regulatory oversight.

Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh joins Catalysts with Madison Mills to discuss Meta's record-setting run. "So when you look at the time spent on the internet, Meta owns a good chunk of it," Singh says, highlighting Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, which "all have north of 1 billion daily active users." "What they have done very successfully in the case of Meta is apply AI across their apps. I mean, people talk about the ROI [return on investment] on GenAI [and] Meta is one of the prime examples of how effectively they have added new tools to create ads using generative AI to target ads using AI," the analyst says, adding, "That's why all the infrastructure that they have invested in the CapEx raise is really translating into higher ad pricing and better engagement on their platform." Recent reports state Arm Holdings (ARM) is making its own semiconductor chips and has secured Meta as its first customer. As hyperscalers like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT) invest in developing their own chips, Singh says he's "not surprised [Meta] are taking steps to develop their own chip," especially given the impact of the trade restrictions on the chip sector and the industry's reliance on Nvidia (NVDA).

Morningstar • 9 days ago Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 02/03/2025: Investing in the Cloud Argus believes that 2025 may be defined by 10 investment themes. Throughout the year, we will take a deep dive into these themes, providing updates and giving stock picks on the prominent companies whose businesses play out in each theme. In many cases, we believe these thematic factors will supersede industry characteristics and drive performance. Our Investment Themes for 2025 are: Theme 1: Management Signals; Theme 2: Artificial Intelligence; Theme 3: Clean Energy; Theme 4: Sustainable Impact investing; Theme 5: Innovation; Theme 6: Cybersecurity; Theme 7: Investing in the Cloud; Theme 8: Aerospace and Defense, All Systems Go; Theme 9: Uptick in Capex amid Declining Interest Rates; and Theme 10: Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology. For this week's Weekly List, we examine Theme 7: Investing in the Cloud. Cloud computing has transformed the technology landscape over the past decade. Created almost accidently as a means or organizing customer invoices, cloud has grown from the management of outsourced technology hardware resources to encompass tasks, up to and including software development, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI). Indeed, following availability of ChatGPT in November 2022, awareness of generative AI hit the business community like an electric shock, and has completely upended IT spending plans for the next several years. Given that delivery of AI will mainly occur within a hybrid cloud environment, emergence of AI-as-a-service represents a difficult-to-quantify, but undoubtedly positive driver of cloud service revenues in the coming years. The leading providers of cloud services tend to be large technology and communications services companies that provide many goods and services distinct from or adjacent to their cloud businesses. These companies include Amazon.com, Microsoft, Alphabet, and others in the U.S., along with Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent, and others in China. Collectively, participants in the cloud eco-system grew revenue by a high-teens compound annual rate from 2016 to 2023. Revenue for cloud services has held up well, as cloud transition is a long-tailed process and cloud transformation has become an imperative. According to IDC, revenue in the industry grew 21% in 2024. Looking ahead, with inflation growth slowing and amid improving business and consumer confidence, both consumer device demand and enterprise IT spending should accelerate. We expect rising device demand and enterprise IT spending both domestically and internationally to drive cloud investment in 2025 and beyond. Some of the companies that should benefit in the space include the following. Argus • 12 days ago Market concerns remain over GenAI spend Microsoft is the world's largest independent software developer. The company was founded on the MS Windows operating system and MS Office business applications suite for PCs. As it has grown, Microsoft has expanded into enterprise software with Windows Server, SQL Server, Dynamics CRM, SharePoint, Azure, and Lync; hardware with the Xbox gaming/media platform and the Surface tablet; and online services through MSN and Bing. Microsoft acquired Skype, the internet VoIP communications service, in October 2011. More than 50% of revenue is generated outside the U.S. Rating Price Target Argus • 12 days ago Monday Tee Up: Tariffs, Jobs, Earnings

Newly imposed U.S. tariffs Monday Tee Up: Tariffs, Jobs, Earnings Newly imposed U.S. tariffs (and the responses to them by the impacted countries) combine with the jobs report (due to hit the tape on Friday) and the ongoing flood or earnings reports to set the stage for a busy week. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3%, the S&P 500 fell 1.0%, and the Nasdaq dropped 1.6%. So far in 2025, the DJIA is up 5%, the S&P is up 3%, and the Nasdaq is up 2%. Over the weekend, President Trump imposed tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada. Canada announced their own retaliatory tariffs and, as of this writing, Mexico intends to respond. China said it will file a complaint with the World Trade Organization. The markets likely will experience some volatility as Wall Street assesses the impact of the tariffs. Items to consider are possible increased prices, supply-chain hiccups, changes to consumer spending patterns, and an uptick in overall inflation.  Meanwhile, the earnings flow continues. On Monday, Palantir, Tyson Foods, and Clorox are among the companies that will report; on Tuesday, Alphabet, Advanced Micro, Merck, Amgen, and PepsiCo; on Wednesday, Novo Nordisk, Qualcomm, Uber, and Disney; on Thursday, Amazon.com, Eli Lilly, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Honeywell, and ConocoPhillips; and on Friday, Fortive, Kimco, and Cboe Global. Some 178 (or 36%) of the S&P 500 companies have reported for last quarter. Earnings so far are showing 12% growth from the prior-year quarter. That compares to a 9% growth rate last quarter. The Financial sector has had the most companies report, and the growth rate so far is 13%, according to Refinitiv. Argus forecasts S&P 500 EPS growth in 2025 at 12%. For 2026, we forecast 11. On the economic calendar, the Nonfarm Payrolls report for January comes out on Friday. Though that report will get the most attention, the Call of the Week from Argus' Chief Economist Chris Graja, CFA, is Nonfarm Productivity. Chris expects growth to top 2%, while the consensus is 1.7%. Chris offers the following thoughts. 'While the jobs report provides a timely assessment of how the economy is doing, productivity, though volatile, is the best measure of a country's long-term prosperity and of workers ability to earn more than the inflation rate. Worker prosperity will dominate the American political landscape for the next four years. Productivity growth also will reflect the degree of success from the billions being spent on Artificial Intelligence.'  Last week, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged, as expected. Mortgage rates dipped one basis point, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage now at 6.95%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices fell a penny to an average of $3.10 per gallon for regular gas. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow indicator is forecasting for 1Q and calls for expansion of 2.9%. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast is forecasting for January and is at 2.85%. The next Fed rate decision is on March 19, with odds at 17% for a rate cut, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool. After that, the next meeting is in early May.

Learn more Frequently Asked Questions Expand All | Collapse All Why are software updates necessary? Microsoft is committed to providing its customers with software that has been tested for safety and security. Although no system is completely secure, we use processes, technology, and several specially focused teams to investigate, fix, and learn from security issues to help us meet this goal and to provide guidance to customers on how to help protect their PCs. As part of the Microsoft software release process, all software released to the Download Center is scanned for malware before it is made available for public download. Additionally, after release, the software available from the Download Center is routinely scanned for malware. Microsoft recognizes that the threat environment is constantly changing and will continue to evolve over time, and we are committed to process improvements that will help protect our customers from malware threats How can I keep my software up to date? Microsoft offers a range of online services to help you keep your computer up to date. Windows Update finds updates that you might not even be aware of and provides you with the simplest way to install updates that help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience. Visit Windows Update to learn more. What can I find in the Microsoft Download Center, and how do I find what I’m looking for? The Microsoft Download Center has recently been revised to better serve you as a one-stop shop for products available for purchase, in addition to products and downloads available for free. For your convenience, items available for purchase are linked directly to Microsoft Store. Items available as free downloads are linked to details pages, where you can learn more about them and initiate downloads. If you would like Microsoft to scan your computer and recommend updates, please see the preceding question. If you would like to search for specific downloads, start by using one of these methods. To find products and downloads, in the navigation bar that appears across the center of the Download Center home page, click an icon. To search more specifically for a product or download, on the menu bar displayed near the top of the page, click a menu name and then click a product or download. To search by keyword, at the top of the page, in the Search Download Center search box, type the word or words you wish to search for. On the Search results page, you may see the following: An Editor's choice listing of products and downloads, which are recommendations based on the search term. A Sort by box on the right side of the page. Click the down arrow, and select a display order for the search results. A list of Filter options on the left side of the page. Click a Filter option to narrow the list of items displayed in the search results. The Filter option operates together with the original search term to narrow the scope of search results. When you see the item you’re interested in, click the item link to find out more about downloading or purchasing it. How do I find worldwide downloads? Microsoft delivers downloads in more than 118 languages worldwide. The Download Center now combines all English downloads into a single English Download Center. We no longer offer separate downloads for U.S. English, U.K. English, Australian English, or Canadian English. Select a Worldwide download from the English-language site On the download details page for a particular item, under Quick details, you will see a Change language box. Select the desired language from the drop-down list Note: The Change Language box appears only when a worldwide version of the download is available. If the box does not appear, the download has not yet been made available in languages other than English. If you see the box, but a specific language is not listed, the download is not yet available in that language. Which other Microsoft websites offer downloads? In this section, you will find links to other Microsoft websites that offer downloads. Note that almost all of the downloads available from these websites can also be found in the Microsoft Download Center; however, the other Microsoft sites may offer services and information that you may not find in the Download Center. If you are looking for downloads for the Windows operating system or for Microsoft Office, try using Windows Update , which helps you keep your computer up to date without requiring you to visit the Download Center. DirectX downloads Get the latest version of Microsoft DirectX, and find other important DirectX updates for your version of Windows. Service Packs for Microsoft Products Download service packs containing updates for system reliability, program compatibility, and security. See which service packs are currently available from Microsoft Help and Support. Windows Media Download Center Amplify your play with Microsoft Windows Media Player, encoders, codecs, and other related downloads. Azure downloads Get SDKs and tools for managing and interacting with Azure services Windows developer resources Get downloads and tools for Windows development Code samples Get started with Microsoft developer tools and technologies. Explore our samples and discover the things you can build. What should I do if I can’t find what I am looking for? If you cannot find a specific download, it may be available from a company other than Microsoft. Popular examples include Adobe Reader, Macromedia Shockwave and Flash players, and Java software. For current links to these downloads on their respective websites, use Bing to search the web for the download you are looking for. What information will I find on download pages? When you click a download item in the Download Center, you will be directed to the download details page for that download. Most of these pages follow a standard format and include most of the sections described here. Quick details The Quick details section contains helpful summary information, including the name and size of the download file and its date of publication. Change language In some cases, you'll see a Change language box, from which you can select a language other than English. Note that some downloads are not available in all languages. In addition, not all non-English downloads are accompanied by localized details pages. As a result, you may find English descriptions and instructions on pages for non-English downloads.
